Create a mobile travel and real-time city discovery application prototype called CityTrail, starting with Jaipur as the default city. The app should open with a simple welcome screen followed by city selection, then lead to a full-screen interactive map showing the user’s live GPS location, a search bar, and category filters such as History, Food Trails, Shopping, Nature, Culture & Experiences, Events, Popular Places, and Hidden Gems. Under the History category, include places like Amer Fort, Nahargarh Fort, Jaigarh Fort, City Palace, Hawa Mahal, Jantar Mantar, Jal Mahal, Albert Hall Museum, Gaitore Ki Chhatriyan, Sisodia Rani Garden, Vidyadhar Garden, Isarlat Tower, Kanak Vrindavan, and Panna Meena Ka Kund. Under Food Trails, include Rawat Misthan Bhandar, LMB, Chokhi Dhani, Masala Chowk, Tapri Central, Handi Restaurant, Niros, Spice Court, MI Road street food, Raja Park food lanes, and Bapu Bazaar food streets. Under Shopping, include Johari Bazaar, Bapu Bazaar, Tripolia Bazaar, Chandpole Bazaar, Nehru Bazaar, MI Road shopping, World Trade Park, GT Central Mall, Kishanpole Bazaar, and Vaishali Nagar markets. Under Nature and Outdoors, include Nahargarh View Point, Jal Mahal Lake area, Jhalana Leopard Safari, Central Park, Ram Niwas Garden, Smriti Van, Garh Ganesh trek, Kukas hills, and Galta Ji hills. Under Culture and Experiences, include Jawahar Kala Kendra, Ravindra Manch, Birla Auditorium, Raj Mandir Cinema, Amer Fort light and sound show, Hawa Mahal night illumination, and Chokhi Dhani cultural shows. Under Events and Everyday Plans, include sunset at Nahargarh, evening walks at Central Park, morning heritage walks in the old city, night food trails at MI Road, and seasonal fairs. Under Hidden Gems, include Panna Meena Ka Kund, Gatore Cenotaphs, Sisodia Rani Garden (early morning), Chandlai Lake, inner temples of Galta Ji, Isarlat tower view, and Kanak Vrindavan during off-hours. As the user walks or drives, nearby attractions from these categories should automatically appear on the map with subtle GPS-style pop-ups like “food place on the left” or “historical monument nearby,” similar to navigation apps. When a user taps a pin or pop-up, show a detailed place screen with name, category, description, historical background if applicable, free or paid entry, opening hours, best time to visit, photos, and action buttons for navigation, saving to itinerary, booking a local guide, or getting a ride via taxi or ride-hailing integration. The app should also allow users to build a day-wise itinerary (morning, afternoon, evening) with smart route suggestions and previews, continue showing nearby attractions even during navigation, and include a light community layer where users can mark places as underrated, leave short tips, or upload photos. The overall design should be clean, modern, and map-first, focusing on effortless, real-time city exploration that feels like Google Maps combined with a local tour guide.
